Creates API documentation for Elixir projects in the [Docsets format](http://kapeli.com/docsets) for use in Dash.app for [MacOS X](http://kapeli.com/dash) or [iOS](http://kapeli.com/dash_ios). This is the first draft so problems may occur.

Template Design is generated by slashing away at [TripIt's Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate) template.

## Installation & Usage

*Please note that you will need to have the `sqlite3` binary installed.*

### As a dependency for your project

Open up your `mix.exs` and add the following to your deps.

```elixir
{:ex_doc_dash, "~> 0.2.0", only: :docs}
```

Build your dependencies

```console
MIX_ENV=docs mix do deps.get, deps.compile
```

Now you can build your Dash.app documentation using the `docs.dash` task and it will be save in `./docs`.

```console
MIX_ENV=docs mix docs.dash
```

### As a global archive

Check out ExDocDash and install as a global dependency:

```console
git clone https://github.com/JonGretar/ExDocDash.git
cd ExDocDash
mix do deps.get, archive.build, archive.install
```

Now you should have the `docs.dash` mix task available in all projects.

**Note that these projects will have to have `ex_doc` and `earmark` as it's dependency as it's not globally installed.**
